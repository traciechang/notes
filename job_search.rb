# - 30 seconds
# - Answers to these questions can come from your work history, academic projects, or even personal projects.
# - Asks about the way you’ve handled projects in the past. 
# - May start with “Tell me about a time when…” or similar. 
# - Request for concrete examples from your past.  
# - Examples:
#     Tell me about a challenge you ran into on that project.
#     What did you like most/least about that project?  
#     Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a supervisor.
#     Tell me about a time you ran into an interpersonal conflict.
#     What did you learn from that experience?  
# - (Spend less time describing problem, and more time on action you took to resolve issues.)

# * Problem/Action/Result (beginning/middle/end)
#  - Problem: The situation that required support or intervention.
#  - Action: What you did to address the problem.
#  - Result: The improved situation produced through your actions.

#  Ex: Tell me about a time you had to 
#  take initiative to get something done.  
 
#  - Problem: "When I was at [RampUp], we needed to store a lot of data but we kept all the data on spreadsheets. There were so many, the sheets were almost impossible to keep updated. Finding basic numbers for a client would sometimes take 30 minutes."
#  -Action: "So I started researching better ways to store information, and found a number of database options online. I researched three different options, presented the pros and cons of each to my manager, and recommended Salesforce as the best fit for us."
#  - Result: "I worked with our office manager to get the system set up, and two months later, we not only had cleaner data that was easier to update, but were able to keep track of almost twice as many metrics as we were before."

#     - Sometimes done on a whiteboard, sometimes with screen share software
#     - Ex: You have a linked list and you want to find the kth to last node. Write a function kth_to_last_node that takes an integer k and the head_node of a linked list, and returns the kth to the last node in the list.

#     - How to do well:

#             - Example inputs and outputs
#             - Talk/ask about edge cases
#         * Plan (45%)
#             - Brainstorm different approaches
#             - Test/analyze (does it work w/ example inputs? time/space complexity, pick best one)
#             - Pseudocode

        What's your favorite thing about your favorite language? What's your least favorite thing about your favorite language?

* Practical Coding Challenges
    -Build Something
    -Make calls to an API
    -Debug
    -Refactor

    Examples:
    1.Build a React component that prints “Hello, world!” to the screen.
    2.Build a digital clock using only vanilla JS, HTML, CSS
    3.Here’s some broken code. Fix it. 

    - Live Coding Tips
        - Waste as little time as possible on setup- practice writing boilerplate code
        - Communicate well- remember your pair programming experience!
        - Remember to test (don’t wait until you’ve coded up the entire problem before testing to see that it works) and analyze along the way
        
    - Suceeding at pratical challenges 
        - Keep coding - don’t let your skills get stale
        - Spend 2.5 hours working on projects or practical coding challenges per day
        - Focus on deepening your understanding as you code
        - JavaScript 30
        - Hackathons

* Architecture and systems design
    - Typically big, vague, broad questions
    - Often times more pseudocode and high level discussion than actual coding
    - Practice good judgement and thoughtfulness in design
    - Be aware of what’s out there

    examples:
        How would you design a URL shortener?
        Design Twitter
        How does a website scale?

    Succeeding at Architecture Questions
        - Start with making sure you understand the end goal
        - Make it conversational
        - Diagrams and visuals (use whiteboard or paper)

    Preparing for Architecture Questions
        - Read 1 High Scalability article per day to get acquainted with the different tools available and their strengths/weaknesses. For example, what is a NoSQL database, why use one? What are its strengths and weaknesses?  (as you read, research the topics you’re not familiar with, make flashcards out of them)
        - Be ready for the often-asked questions (Pay attention in Ned’s lecture)
        - Practice doing this with your everyday websites
        - Youtube series on System Design
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzLMhqg3_Wc
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMZMm_0ZhK4

            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKPNUMkwOJE

* After the Interview
    - Do debrief (what questions did u struggle w/? What topics came up? Write these down for practice/future interviews)

* Negotation
    https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/

    https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/041515/equity-vs-salary-what-you-need-know.asp

    - Negotations Lecture
        - always get any additional info about the position before negotiating salary
            - benefits
            - what's the schedule like
            - how do they review people, when are raises given
        - you do not need to tell them how much other companies are offering, not of their business. You can just tell them I have other offers
        - "I'll forgo other opportunities and sign today if _"

        - Never give the first number. If they ask:
            - "I know its important to a company to have salary info, but I don't want to focus on salary just yet. My priority is to find a company that offers [mentorship/a great product/an excellent team/ whatver matters to you]"
        - If they ask again:
            - "I am confident we'll be able to make an agreement when the time comes"
        - If they keep pushing:
            - I don't have enough info about the role to evaluate it yet, but on [Glassdoor/Indeed/elsewhere] I have that salaries are typically around [find a high number].
        
        - Don't negotiate over the phone
            - They are more experienced than you and can push you and it will go too fast.

        - Outside recruiters may ask who you've applied to - don't tell them.
        - If they ask u what ur previous salary was, u dont owe them that info. You can say "I was in a completely different field before and I expect a market rate salary based on my skills for this position."

        - After getting an offer:
            - Follow up w/ your other leads
                - companies you've interviewed w/ and are waiting to hear back from (u could consolidate the thank u-for-the-interview email w/ this one if u havent thanked them yet)
            - companies that you havent heard back that seem cool
            - companies where you've scheduled an interview that falls outside your deadline
