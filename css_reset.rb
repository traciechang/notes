CSS Reset 10/16/17

- your browser has built in style sheets
- two schools of thought: 1) I should design everything, 2) Built off of defaults

- to reset defaults, do your own:
    - go thru and list out all the tags you have
    <style>
    
        html, body, section, article, h1, h2, p {
            # don't really want to put values in this section
            # may want to include some other things in here, like box sizing. but these are pretty default ones u should memorize
