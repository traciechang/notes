# Intro to UI/UX 1/18/18

# - User Interface
#     - the saddle, stirrup, and reigns
#     - how user interacts w/ it
# - User experience
#     - the feeling u get riding horse
#     - good UX does not mean pretty

# - in interviews, you can say that you are:
#     - product-focused and human-focused

# **********************************************

# UX for Web
# - expect users to muddle thru website, not linear
#     - take advantage of convention
#         - expect search bar will search entire website
#         - when click on logo, takes u to homepage
#         - etc. we expect this because other websites do this as well

    - create effective visual hierarchies
        - should be able to tell what are titles, etc

    - eliminate distractions
        - no extraneous stuff. minimalist is good

- make it mindless, have low expectations of your users
- quality = "less thought needed"

principles of UX design
- keep simple
- guide users to what u want
- everything should be where u expeect
- should do what u expect
- user test to ensure these

- recruiters will not take time to try to figure out how to navigate your site

UI Affordance and Signifiers

perceived affordance - what the user thinks is an affordance
signifier - a clue that an object has an affordance, influencing perceived affordance
    - ex. button is designed that let user know that it can be clicked
    - explicit
    - pattern
    - metaphor
    - negative: absence of affordance
        - ex: greyed out button
    - lying signifier - false perceived affordance (bad)
        - looks like a button but its not clickable

***********************************************

Designing to Look good

- Layout
    - add white space
    - put headings close to texts that follows them

    - Use Grids

    - have text hierarchies (h1, h2, etc)

- Colors
    - use constrained pallete
    - only use a couple Colors

- Fonts
    - easy to read
    - set yourself apart by not using default Font
    - google fonts are good and easy

- Forms
    - one column
    - specify erros inline (near field, instead of all at top/bottom)

- when in doubt, copy someone else (design wise)

- Images
    - don't host images yourself
    - reduce image size
    - images are great

- make purpose of site immediately clear
    - use logo and tagline that get across what the site does
    - dont confuse recruiters
     
- accessibility
    - add alt text to every image
    - use semantic tags and labels
    - dont have flashing stuff

    - significant contrast between text and background
    - adding an "accessible view" button that replaces less accessible typefaces
