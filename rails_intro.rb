# Starting a Rails Project 10/5/17

# - to start a new rails project in terminal:
# -> rails new Dogs  <- by default uses sqlite
# -> rails new Dogs -d postgresql

# - it will create a folder and fills in a bunch of files

# -> cd Cats

# - your gemfile helps keeps stable what gem versions you use throughout the project
# - if you ad gem 'pry-rails', you can use pry
# - you'll never have to update gemfile.lock by hand, it will update when you run bundle install

# Intro to the folders:
# - app:
#  > models: class which represents data from db
#  > view: template

# - config:
#  > database.yml : specifies which db we're connected to
#  > routes.rb : define http routes are available

# - db: pull our seeds file

# - lib: holds classes that we made

# - test: where we write our tests

# ******************************************************************
# Migrations

# **rake is from Rails 4, use rails now

# - paper trail, or record of how database got to current state

# terminal:
# -> rails generate migration CreateCatsTable

# - if you now go to db > migrate, you will see it

# - to run migration:
# -> rake db:migrate

# - if you run into database "something" does not exist, go to database.yml file
# -> rake db:create
# -> rake db:migrate
# - this should run and create your cats table
# - how do we see that it really created it? go to db/schema.rb to check
# - you won't see id, but it's added in

# -> rails g migration CreateToys
# - this should make a new migration called CreateToys
# - recommended that you put timestamps on every one you create

# -> rake db:migrate
# - what happens if you forgot to add a column after you run migrate?
# - if you try to add it and run migrate again, it won't do anything cuz it keeps track of what u already migrate
# -> rake db:rollback
# - it undo what we did, it deleted entire table. however, this will probably give u error if u did more than create a table
# - now u can add your column and migrate again.
# - if you had already pushed to github and production, you don't want to rollback (unless u are in development)
# - instead, make a new migration w/ ur corrected stuff.

# -> rails g migration AddColorToCats to change our cat table

# - migrations are meant to change the format of the table, not individual rows

# ******************************************************************
# Models 10/16/17

# - using rails to interact w/ content of our tables. It will give us object oriented way to interact

# - In text editor, right click models folder and click New File and give it the singular version of your table (ex. cat.rb)
# - name of class and name of file should be same

# class Cat < ActiveRecord::Base
# end

# - to open rails console, go to terminal and type:
# rails console -or- 
# rails c

# - you can create an instance locally (c = Cat.new) and set things we've defined (c.name = "sarah")
# -> c.save | this will insert your instance into database
# -> sarah = Cat.first | this gets the first row from the db and assigns those data to sarah

# -> jeff = Cat.new(name: "Jeff", color: "green") | you can also pass in an options hash 
# -> jeff.save
# -> Cat.all | to see all your cats
# -> Cat.last | to see last cat in db
# -> jeff.destroy |removes jeff from db

# -> Cat.find(1) | finds the cat with id # 1
# -> Cat.find_by(name: "sarah") to find by something other than id

# -> Cat.create(name: "Jeff", color: "orange") | this create an instance AND save to db

# ******************************************************************
# Basic Associations (belongs to, has many)

# - macros:
# class Cat < ActiveRecord::Base
# 	belongs_to :house, #the name of the method you want as the instance method
# 		primary_key: :id, #the primary key of the other table (house)
# 		foreign_key: :house_id, #the name of column of this table that points to primary key of other table
# 		class_name: 'House'
	
# end

# -> jeff = Cat.last
# -> jeff.house #should give you Jeff's house now

# class House < ActiveRecord::Base
# 	def cats
# 		Cat.where(house_id: self.id)
# 	end
# end

# - the equivalent to the above is:
# class House < ActiveRecord::Base
# 	has_many :cats,
# 		primary_key: id,
# 		foreign_key: :house_id,
# 		class_name: 'Cat'
# end

# -> beach = House.last
# -> beach.cats #return all cats living in this hosue

# -> beach.cats = Cats.all #this actually updated all cats to this beach house
# this means that the method cats that we defined is also a setter method, that it also did these things:
# def cats
# 	#...
# end

# def cats=(arg)
# 	#...
# end

# r = House.first
# r.cats # should be empty now that we placed all cats into beach house
# r.cats << Cat.first #shovels first cat into r.cats. It changed the house of the first cat to r

# ******************************************************************
# Basic Associations (has many, through)

# - what if we wanted to find all of the toys in a house?

# class House < ActiveRecord::Base
# 	has_many :cats,
# 		primary_key: id,
# 		foreign_key: :house_id,
# 		class_name: 'Cat'

# 	has_many :toys, #name of your method	
# 		through: :cats, #name of association IN THIS CLASS
# 		source: :toys #name of assocation in cat class

# 	# instead of doing it this way, we're going to use has many, thru
# 	def toys
# 		toys = []
# 		self.cats.each do |cat|
# 			toys += cat.toys
# 		end
# 		toys
# 	end

# -> h = House.first
# -> h.toys #should get all toys in this house


# class Toy < ActiveRecord::Base
# 	belongs_to :cat,
# 		primary_key: :id,
# 		foreign_key: :cat_id,
# 		class_name: 'Cat'

# 	has_one :house, # use has_one because a toy can only be in one house. it only returns one thing
# 		through: :cat,
# 		source: :house
	
# 	#equivalent of above
# 	def house
# 		<<-SQL
# 		select *
# 		from cats
# 		join houses
# 		on cats.house_id = houses.id
# 		where id = #{self.cat_id}
# 		SQL
# 		.first
# 	end
# end

# ******************************************************************
# Validations

# - if we tried to save a cat with no id, we get a db error. We want to prevent db errors to be thrown, so we add a protection layer by validating in our models
# - .valid? checks to see if our object is ready to be inserted into db, that is, if all our validations pass

# - Cat.all.pluck(:name) #give you an array of all cat names
# - however, when it returns only true / false, how do you know what you did wrong?
# - c.errors #will give u error

# Customer Validations

# class Cat < ActiveRecord::Base
# 	validate :no_green_cats
# end

# def no_green_cats
# 	if self.color == "green"
# 		self.errors[:color] << "can't be green"	#the symbol on this line is the column that you're checking
# 	end
# end

# -> c = Cat.new(name: 'mike', color: 'green')
# -> c.valid? #=>false
# -> c.error.full_messages #=> COlor can't be green
# -> c.name = nil #=> you should now get two errors in an array: name can't be blank and color cant be green

# ******************************************************************
# Indices

# - speed up lookup in our active record tables
# - you index columns that you frequently use
# - what is an index? a tree
# - we don't make index for all columns because it takes up space
# - very common to add index while ur creating table
# - if you wanted to do a uniqueness validation on the db level, you'd be using indexes

# ******************************************************************
# API - Application Program Interface 10/25/17

# - Ex. Ruby object API: its public methods

# - Rails application ex:
#  -> make GET request to /cats

# - what happens when you go to google.com:
#  > sends to server
#  > server sends back things such as: HTML, CSS, JS, images
#  > you get back all these assets and the browser will render them

# - disctinction between 
#  1. Website - includes assets to be rendered by browser
#  2. Webservice(API) - just data
# 	ex: server to server
# 	ex: maybe your phone requests data (mobile app) and the phone itself knows how to render that data
# 	ex: client side rendering of data (SPA - single page application)
# 		> example of this is gmail. you're doing a bunch of stuff on one page (send, go to inbox, etc.) but you stay on one page

# ************************************************************
# HTTP Request/Response

# Client (you on your laptop) makes an HTTP request to Server
# - in the request:
#   - method(GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, etc...)
#   - path (/users)
#   - query (?loc=SF&name)
#   - body (additional data. ex: email, password, age). Can't use with GET request.


# Server sends HTTP response back
# - Response
#   - status (200 OK, 404 NOT FOUND)
#   - body (main chunk of what comes back. ex: html, css, js needed to render website)

# We want to learn how to make a request to get the response you want.

************************************************************
Rails Routing

Server
> HTTP request comes in , received by Rails

Router

> 1st hits Router: doesn't know how to deal w/ just knows to send to proper "person" to deal w/ and WHAT it needs to do
	- path
	- method
> it has a list of combo of path and methods and which controllers for these
> ex: UsersControllers
> controllers have action (methods defined on controllers)

1. Router checks routes
2. Initialize a controller
3. Call the right action

Router will check this list: routes.rb file

# ******************************************************************
# By I:
# - Adding index to certain columns makes it treat it like a hash/tree rather than array (it will usually look thru as if an array)

# Misc: launchy pusheen.com <- didnâ€™t work
# -> bundle exec launchy pusheen.com
# - make it a habit of using bundle exec when you have a gemfile

# ******************************************************************
# By I

# class SomeClass
  # def some_method
    # puts 'this is some method'
  # end
# end
