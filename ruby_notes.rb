#my notes

# Falsey:
# - false
# - nil

# - destructuring

# git
# - a way to save your progress
# - commands:
# - git init #when you want to create repo
# - git status
# - git diff (see what you added)
# 	-> q to quite

# # 	git add
# 	-> then need to specify a file
# 	-'-A' -> means add every file that has not yet been committed

# #	git commit -m "this is my first commit"
# # git log
# # git commit --amend -m "your message here" #to change the message

# ##############
# ## try putting something in ruby_scratch.rb and save the file
# ## now type git diff if you want to see what you added
# ## git add -A
# ## git status
# ## git commit -m "add my first line"
# ## git log
# ## git push

# #############
# 1. on c9, created repository locally (like having a pic on your local machine)
# 2. now push local repository to remote (github) (like putting on dropbox and access available anywhere)
# 3. copy url and go back to c9 (need to tell it where to go)
# 	# git remote
# 	# git remote add origin [paste url]
# 	# git remote (now u should have origin)
# 	# git push
# 	-> could not push since we created a readme initially on github
# 	-> it wants u to update locally to what it looks like remotely first
# 	# git pull origin master

# * create on github first

# ##################
# git clone [url] (after you already create repo on git)

# 3 basic steps:
# add -A
# commit -m ""
# push



# method_missing
# - write method so that whatever method you call, it will do same thing
# - Metaprogramming
# 	-> difficult to find and debug because method is not explicitly defined

Ian:

- polytree node*
- html header. the ../.. part
- TTT AI supercomp.rb -> why mine dun work
- mancala w2d2 (next_turn method)
-w2d3 - shoul i be using this? guard spec
- w2d4 Execution Time/algorithms (don't understand how I could have come up w/ last solution)

If time:
- Ghost AI Player (incomplete)
- Maze Solver (not started)
- Memory Bonus (not started)
- revise ruby_notes
- w1d4 Screwdoku (debugging exercise)

Need to practice:
git branching
git working on project w/ diff people (see minesweeper instructions)

Pair:
- 8 queens
- D4 minesweeper
- D5 Knights TTravails after get explanation for polytree node
